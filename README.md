# Python-Activity-Logger
This modular Python surveillance tool captures endpoint telemetry for cybersecurity research. It runs concurrent listeners using multithreading techniques for keystrokes, mouse activity, and window activity using pynput and win32gui. Data is automatically exfiltrated via email, demonstrating effective red-teaming and data extraction techniques.
